<p style="text-align:center"><b><i>
An unsecured credit card is just another name for a "regular" credit card. Unsecured means that debt on the card is not backed or secured by collateral. All the lender has is your promise to pay it back.

With traditional loans, you must offer something as collateral to reduce the risk to the lender that you won't repay the money. A car loan or home mortgage, for example, is backed by the car or house itself. If you fail to make your payments, a repo man will come to take your car or the bank will foreclose on the house. Go to a pawnshop and hock your old guitar for cash â€” same concept. You can get your guitar back when you repay the loan. Keep the money, and the pawnbroker sells the guitar. Loans with collateral are referred to as secured.
