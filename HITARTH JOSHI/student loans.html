The Indian government has launched a portal, Vidya Lakshmi, for students seeking educational loans and five banks including SBI, IDBI Bank and Bank of India have integrated their system with the portal. Vidya Lakshmi was launched on the occasion of Independence Day i.e. 15 August 2015 for the benefit of students seeking educational loans. Vidya Lakshmi was developed under three departments of India i.e. Department of Financial Services, Department of Higher Education and Indian Banks Association (IBA). Vidya Lakshmi Portal has been developed under the Pradhan Mantri Vidya Lakshmi Karyakram and announced by the finance minister Shri Arun Jaitley in the budget speech of FY 2015–16. As of August 15, 2020, 37 banks were registered on the Vidya Lakshmi Portal and offered 137 loan schemes [8]

To bridge the constraint of increasing institutional fees, NSDL e-Governance in India launched the Vidyasaarathi portal to help students seeking scholarship for studies in India or overseas.

The education loan is expected to grow at a rate of 32.3 percent in 2009-10, 39.8 percent each in 2010-11and 2011-12, and 44.8 percent during the period 2012–13 to 2014–15.
